        YooChoose Dataset.
        Task of YooChoose dataset: given a sequence of click events performed by
        some users during a typical session in an e-commerce website, the goal is
        to predict whether the user is going to buy something or not, and if he is
        buying, what would be the items he is going to buy. The task could therefore
        be divided into two sub goals:
            1. Is the user going to buy items in this session? YES|NO
            2. If yes, what are the items that are going to be bought?
        This dataset contains two subsets:
            1. yoochoose-clicks.dat
                - SessionID: the id of the session.
                - Timestamp: the time when the click occurred.
                - ItemID: the unique identifier of the item.
                - Category: the category of the item.
            2. yoochoose-buys.dat
                - SessionID: the id of the session.
                - Timestamp: the time when the click occurred.
                - ItemID: the unique identifier of the item.
                - Price: the price of the item.
                - Quantity: how many of this item were bought.

        If the dataset can not be download by the url,
        you need to down the dataset by the link:
            https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/yc-rdata/yoochoose-data.7z.
        then put it into the directory `yoochoose/raw` and unzip it.
